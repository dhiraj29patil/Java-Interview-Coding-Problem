Q). Calculate the Length of String without using the Length() function.

I/P : "dhiraj";

O/P : 6;

*).Time Complexity : O(n)

The time complexity for this code is O(N), where N is the length of the input string str. The for loop iterates through each character in the string, and because the length of the string determines the number of iterations, the time complexity is linearly dependent on the input size.

*).Space Complexity : O(n)

The space complexity for this code is O(1). It uses a constant amount of extra space. The length variable is the only additional space used, and it remains constant regardless of the input string size.
