Q).Remove the vowels from a String.

I/P : "dhiraj";

O/P : "dhrj";

*). Time Complexity : O(n)

In this code, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input string str. The for loop iterates through each character in the string, and the isVowel function, which performs constant-time operations, is called for each character.

*). Space Complexity : O(n)

The space complexity for this code is O(N). It's because the ans string is built by concatenating non-vowel characters. String concatenation in Java involves creating new strings. As the loop progresses through the input string, a new string ans is created and grows in size linearly with the input string str.
