Q). Remove Characters from String excepts Alphabets.

I/P : "D0h@i&r3aj-";

O/P : "Dhiraj";

*). Time Complexity : O(n)

The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input string str. The for loop iterates through each character in the string, and the isAlphabet function performs constant-time operations for each character.

*). Space Complexity : O(n)

The space complexity is also O(N). The ans string is built by concatenating valid alphabet characters from the input string str. As the loop progresses through the input string, a new string ans is created and grows in size linearly with the size of the input string.
