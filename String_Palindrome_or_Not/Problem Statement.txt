Q).Check if the given string is Palindrome or not .

I/P : "abba";		I/P : "dhiraj";

O/P : Palindrome;	O/P : Not Palindrome;

*). Time Complexity : O(n)

The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input string str. The for loop iterates through half of the string length to create the reversed string ans, performing constant-time operations for each character.

*). Space Complexity : O(n)

The space complexity is also O(N). This is due to the string concatenation inside the loop (ans += str.charAt(i)), which creates a new string ans and increases in size linearly with the input string str.
